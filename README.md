# Data Analysis of Online Music Service

This project helped me gain experience processing and cleaning datasets, building data structures to support analysis, and performing data analysis to answer specific questions.

In this project, I wrote a Python program to analyze data from  the online music service, last.fm. I used a dataset that was released as part of the HetRec Workshop at the 2011 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. A zip file containing the data is made available by the Grouplens research team at the University of Minnesota. To download it, go to the page: http://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/ and download the file: hetrec2011-lastfm-2k.zip

This dataset is just a sampling of data from last.fm, but it is a good example of the type of real-world data that data analysts work with. There are 1892 user ids and 17,632 artists. There are 92,834 user -artist relationships, and 25,434 friend relationships.

Questions I answered include:

* Who are the top artists in terms of play counts?
* What artists have the most listeners? 
* Who are the top users in terms of play counts? 
* What artists have the highest average number of plays per listener?
* What artists with at least 50 listeners have the highest average number of plays per listener?
* Do users with five or more friends listen to more songs? 
* How similar are two artists?
* Analysis of top tagged artists.
